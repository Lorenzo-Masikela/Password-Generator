<h1>Password Generator</h1>
</center>

The simple Password Generator app is a system that generate random passwords ranging from weak to strong password and when you satisfied with your password, you can copy it.
<br>Programming languages used are:
- HTML for the web-based app structure and body,
- Css for the design and look of the system, and
- Javascript for the button.

<br>This simple app can be useful for people who want a strong password but don't want to think hard and be predictable.
You can add symbols, numbers, and choose to exclude any duplicating characters and spaces in between characters.
At a press of a button you can get endless password ideas, which can be used anyhow.
